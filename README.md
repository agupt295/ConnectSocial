# Social Media Application
This application is built to help people connect meaningfully. It lets users make friends with recommendations based on mutual connections. They can easily share photos and tag people. Moreover, they can like and comment on each other's photos, making engagement fun and interactive.

[Following are the tech stacks used]:

## Frontend
### JavaFX Scene Builder

It simplifies the process of designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Java applications. With its drag-and-drop interface, developers can easily create complex layouts and UI components without writing extensive code.

## Backend
### JDBC
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) serves as the backbone for connecting Java applications to relational databases.

### PostgreSQL Database
PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system that follows the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which are the fundamental principles of transactional database systems.


## Database Implementation

Please note that the database used in this project has been implemented locally and may not be directly testable in its current state. However, for your reference and understanding, I have provided images showcasing the database schema and structure.
